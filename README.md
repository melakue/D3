# D3

Analyzing metro paper data to determine the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings.
The editor of the paper wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. The data set used is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml. The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

* create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.
* Using the D3 techniques and create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 
* Include state abbreviations in the circles.
* Create and situate axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
* make the graphu interactive. Place additional labels in scatter plot and give them click events so that when users can decide which data to display. 
* Incorporate d3-tip
